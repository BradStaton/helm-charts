# helm-charts

Helm charts for various tools that I find useful that otherwise didn't have a chart to use.

## Cloudflare DDNS

[Cloudflare DDNS](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns) updates Cloudflare DNS records when a dyanmic IP address changes.  The [chart](./charts/cloudflare-ddns) allows maintaining a deployment of the application to a k8s cluster via Helm.
